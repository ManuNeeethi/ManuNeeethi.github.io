Namaste everyone!

I am ManuNeethi. I am a practicing Hindu Aruvela Niyogi Brahmana. I am from Karnataka, India. I have been spending some time to understand my religion(Sanatana Dharma) better. This is a place where I document all of it - books/articles/texts I read, videos I watch, resources scholars and friends share on social media(mainly twitter) and a few opinions on some topics. I am particularly interested in understanding the Hindu society better, temples, traditions, practices, rituals, festivals and ofcourse caste - specifically look at all of this from a traditional point of view and more from inside the tradition(rather than like a foreigner).
