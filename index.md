Namaste everyone!

This is a place where I collect everything I read/find interesting about Sanatana Dharma. Focus is mostly about understanding my religion from a traditional point of view - from inside the religion, from inside the tradition/sampradaya, from inside the Jaati instead of the usual approach where Sanatana Dharma and the Hindu society is analyzed from outside as a foreigner.
